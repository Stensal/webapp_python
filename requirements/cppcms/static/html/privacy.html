<h3 class="stensal_title">Stensal Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Last Updated: January 9th, 2017</p>
<p>Your access to, and use of, the Site and Software is subject to Stensal’s Website Terms of Use or the Beta Test Agreement, as applicable (each, the “<strong>Terms</strong>”). Subject to the provisions of applicable laws, any personal information you submit to Stensal will not be used in any manner to which you have not consented. This privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes how Stensal protects the privacy and security of personally identifiable information of users of our Site and Software, including our mobile applications. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the Terms. By using the Site or Software, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Stensal in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or Software. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will advise you of the changes through postings on our website, social media sites, email or push notifications. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Stensal treats personally identifiable information that it collects and receives through the Site or Software. Personal information is information specific to you that is personally identifiable (e.g., your name, address, e-mail address or phone number) and not otherwise publicly available. This Privacy Policy does not cover, supersede or affect the terms of any policy or agreement between you and any third party (such as our third party credit card processors, Apple, Google and other parties with whom you share personal information). If you use any other services, you should make sure that you understand the privacy policies of those third party providers.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">What information do we collect?</h4>
<p>We may collect personal information under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you create an account or download Software, we may ask you for your name, age, geo-location and other demographic information, e-mail address, street address or other personal information. You may, however, visit our Site without providing such personal information.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use IP addresses and session identifiers to analyze trends, to administer the Site and Software, to track user activities, to infer user interests, and to otherwise induce, deduce, and gather information about individual users and market segments. We may collect your browser-type, operating system and other software or hardware information.</p></li>
<li><p>We may collect information about searches and queries you perform, other users you interact with, your use of the Software and other related information.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use internal tools and third party applications and services (such as Google Analytics) to collect and analyze information.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use &quot;cookies&quot; to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our Site. Please refer to the &quot;Do we use 'cookies'?&quot; section below for information about cookies and how we use them.</p></li>
<li><p>We will also collect any information that you provide to us if you correspond with us or post any content through the Software.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are under 18, you should always get permission from your parents before providing any personal information (such as your name or email address). We do not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to register an account with us or provide other personal information.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">How do we use your information?</h4>
<p>We may use the information we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To personalize your Site experience and the Software and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</p></li>
<li><p>To allow us to provide better service and respond to your customer service requests.</p></li>
<li><p>To administer a promotion, survey or other Site or Software feature.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide advertising relevant to you.</p></li>
<li><p>To respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.</p></li>
<li><p>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding alleged or actual illegal activities, violations of the applicable Terms, or as otherwise required by law.</p></li>
<li><p>We may also share information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent. Please keep in mind that any information that you post on our Site or through our Software and make available to other users may become publicly available. All sharing of information is done at your own risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="stensal_title">Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h4>
<p>We generally do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described in this Privacy Policy. The term &quot;outside parties&quot; does not include our affiliates and any other parties who assist us in offering Software, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. If we sell our company, or otherwise transfer any assets of our company (including in the event of a sale in connection with a bankruptcy), we may provide your personal information to the purchaser. We may also release your personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>
<p>We may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, usage and related information.</p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">Do we use &quot;cookies&quot; or other tracking technology?</h4>
<p>We may use cookies. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we may use cookies to help us remember items you have searched for in the past. Cookies can also help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved Software. We may also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
<p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors and end users. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (such as Chrome, iOS, Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to features that make your Site experience more efficient and some of our services may not function properly, and registered users may not be able to login properly.</p>
<p>We (and our third party service providers) may also use technologies such as beacons, scripts, tags and clear gifs. These technologies may be used to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users across the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base on the whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual and aggregate basis.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">How do we handle “do not track” signals?</h4>
<p>Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, we do not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title" >How do I opt-out of information collection?</h4>
<p>You may opt out of information collection at any time by uninstalling any apps or Software that we may offer from all of your devices, and/or by deactivating any account you may have created.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">How do we safeguard your personal information?</h4>
<p>Stensal follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use your personally identifiable information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">Does this Privacy Policy cover third party links?</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site. In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our Site, including third party advertising companies. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">Does this Privacy Policy apply to offline information?</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our Site or Software and not to information collected offline. Do you collect information from other sources? We may also supplement the information that we collect with information with other sources, such as page view information, credit history and similar information from credit bureaus and information that you may make available from social media such as facebook and Twitter.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">How do you ask questions and provide feedback?</h4>
<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or any feedback, please contact our privacy team at policy@stensalinc.com.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">Is my information transferred to other countries?</h4>
<p>It is important to note that the Site and Software are offered under United States law. However, we may transfer your information to other countries, which may have different data protections laws from the United States. By using the Site or Software and/or providing us with your visitor information, you consent to this transfer. How do you correct or update personal information? You can correct or update your personal information by re-registering, updating your profile, or by contacting us by electronic-mail support@stensalinc.come or sending a written request to:</p>

<p>However, we will maintain copies of your information to the extent retained as part of our standard backup/archive process. In addition, these procedures will not remove any of your information that you have provided to other users or third parties, or that has been collected from you by third parties linked from the Site or Software.</p>
<h4 class="stensal_title">How do we protect children’s privacy?</h4>
<h5 class="stensal_title">Under Age 13</h5>
<p>We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the interactive online world. The Site and Software are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children thirteen (13) years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of thirteen (13). No one under the age of thirteen (13) should submit any personal information to Stensal.</p>
<h5 class="stensal_title">Under Age 18</h5>
<p>Minors under 18 years of age may have the personal information that they have provided to Stensal while using this Site or the Software deleted by sending an email to privacy@stensalinc.com requesting deletion. Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems.</p>
